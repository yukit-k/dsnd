    "#### Categorical Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main ways for working with categorical variables is using 0, 1 encodings.  In this technique, you create a new column for every level of the categorical variable.  The **advantages** of this approach include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The ability to have differing influences of each level on the response.\n",
    "2. You do not impose a rank of the categories.\n",
    "3. The ability to interpret the results more easily than other encodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **disadvantages** of this approach are that you introduce a large number of effects into your model.  If you have a large number of categorical variables or categorical variables with a large number of levels, but not a large sample size, you might not be able to estimate the impact of each of these variables on your response variable.  There are some rules of thumb that suggest 10 data points for each variable you add to your model.  That is 10 rows for each column.  This is a reasonable lower bound, but the larger your sample (assuming it is representative), the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try out adding dummy variables for the categorical variables into the model.  We will compare to see the improvement over the original model only using quantitative variables.  \n",
