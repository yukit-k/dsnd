    "`8.` When using all 4 latent features, we saw that we could exactly reproduce the user-movie matrix.  Now that we only have 2 latent features, we might measure how well we are able to reproduce the original matrix by looking at the sum of squared errors from each rating produced by taking the dot product as compared to the actual rating.  Find the sum of squared error based on only the two latent features, and use the following cell to test against the solution. "
